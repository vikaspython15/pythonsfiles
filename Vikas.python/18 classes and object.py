''' OOPs is based on concept of objects...
 which can contain data and code. Data in form of Fields
 (often knows as attributes and properties) and Code in form of procedures (often known of methods)'''

#class Employee:
#    no_of_leaves = 30   # creating a class
#    increment = 5000    # instant variable of a class
    
    
#emp1 = Employee()
#emp2 = Employee()

#print(emp1.no_of_leaves)
#print(emp1. increment)

#emp1.name = "Ramesh"
#emp1.age = 32
#emp1.salary = 23000

#emp2.name = "Naveen"
#emp2.age = 30
#emp2.salary = 25000

#The object of a class can access all the properties of 
#that class.

#print(emp1.name)
#print(emp2. salary)
